## How do I create a project?

Once you've joined the [hackathon Discord channel](https://aka.ms/mlnet-hackathon-discord), create a project by [submitting an issue to the repository](https://github.com/virtualmlnet/hackathon-2020/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=idea.md&title=ML.NET+Hackathon+Idea).

## Can I bring an existing project?

No. Only new projects started on November 12 will be considered for submission.

## Do I need to be on a team?

Although we encourage collaboration between participants, we're also happy to have teams of one person. Like most projects, the team is intended to bring together people that want to solve a similar problem. 

## What types of projects can I work on?

Though this list is not exhaustive, it may provide some guidance:

- Contributions to the [dotnet/machinelearning](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) repository
- Build tooling for ML.NET
- End-user applications (train and deploy machine learning models)
- Other (trainings, videos, articles)

For some ideas, see the [project ideas page](project-ideas.md) or last year's [submissions](https://github.com/virtualmlnet/hackathon-2020/tree/main/submissions).

## Do I have to use ML.NET?

Yes. Where you use ML.NET is your choice, but it is expected you use or extend ML.NET in your solution.

## When are submissions due?
